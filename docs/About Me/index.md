Hello all, My name is Matthew Tobino. I am an undergrad student an Rowan Univeristy studying computer science. If anyone asks how I got into the sciences, the real answer is Tony Stark. The Marvel movies really made it look so simple to build new technology out of nothing. I am big into video games, anime, sports, and the gym. Video games have always been a big part of my life, ever since my dad let me play my first one alongside him (Mass Effect). My brother got me into anime after I complained that there wasn't enough action in the shows I was watching. After he showed me the stuff he was watching, I fell in love with the genre. I am not the best athelete by any means, but my friends love to play competitive sports, so I had to learn to keep up somehow. The gym has a special place for me as I find it to be a nice calming place and a place I can always rely on to better improve myself.
