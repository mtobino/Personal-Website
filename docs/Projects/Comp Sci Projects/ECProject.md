# Small Skill Demo Project

Small project to demonstrate capabilities to read input from a file, write output to a file, create classes, and use the Collection Classes of List and Map. The project 
starts with a a list of staff workers for the school. The list is unsorted between student workers and staff workers. The main difference is in their ID number which 
determines if they are a student or a full-time staff member. All students ID numbers start with 916 and all full-time staff ID numbers start with 841. The program will
sort the members by student and staff and write the output to a new file.
