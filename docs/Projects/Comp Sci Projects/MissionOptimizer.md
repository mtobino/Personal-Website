# Mission Training Optimizer Project

## Description
### Project Prompt
In our Software Engineering class we are provided a list of clients are the products they would like us to complete. For our project, the team chose to do a Mission Training Optimizer with the USAF. The client requested a database with an API to converse with it. Additionally, they want the abilty to visualize any trends in the data. They also expressed a desire for only certain members to have the right to edit the database, while other members will only be able to see the data in the database and the visualized data. To give the client a visualization of their data, we used PowerBI to interface with our database to present the data in an easy-to-analyze format. 
### Handling user authorization
To enter the site, a user must have an existing login. These are created alongside the admins to ensure they have total control of who can access the sensitive data. If the user is not authorized to make changes, they will only have access to the PowerBI reports and the ability to see the raw contents of the database. If the user does have editing access, they will have the ability to input data into a database through Excel sheets and via manual uploads. This allows the user to perform mass uploads of their previously tracked data, or enter in new data in a form built to match the Excel sheet format. If an authorized user accidentally inserts incorrect information into the database, a user with admin privledges must go in and fix the change through an update or by deleting the entry all together. This gives admins the final say about what should be in the database.

## My Agile Scrum Role
### Product Owner
As the Product Owner, I was tasked with managing the backlog of the product and the sprints. I was also in charge of maintiaining communication with the client and setting the meeting dates for the sprints with the client and the team. Additionally, I delegated as many tasks as I could to my team members based upon the skills they expressed in our intial meeting. This allowed me to streamline our productivity by making sure everyone was doing a task they could handle. If a team member felt like they needed help, or if there was an area that the development team was struggling with, I would step in and try to resolve the problem. In these moments, I was able to setup both the backend and the frontend of the product so the team could focus better on their individual tasks.
