# Containerization and RMI Project

## Description
The project utilizes a Docker network to facilitate the communication between a Gumball Machine Monitor and a Gumball 
Machine. The Gumball Machine code is not my own as it was from the Head First Object-Oriented Design and Analysis Book 
by Brett McLaughlin and Gary Pollice. The code to facilitate communication between the Monitor and its Machines is my code. 

## Video Demonstration

Here is a video demonstration used to showcase the final result
