I am recent graduate from Rowan University with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and a Concentration in Software Engineering. I originally started out as a Mechanical Engineering Student, but I found I 
had a greater aptitude for coding than physics. However, that did not stop me from succeeding in the engineering courses as I have maintained Dean's List throughout every 
semester. I feel taking these engineering classes helped me to have an open mind toward my coding and helped me to tackle my problems in a better and more
efficient manner. I have graduated Summa Cum Laude and members of Upsilon Pi Epsilon and Pi Mu Epsilon.
