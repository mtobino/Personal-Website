I am a rising senior at Rowan University pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I originally started out as a Mechanical Engineering Student, but I found I 
had a greater aptitude for coding than physics. However, that did not stop me from succeeding in the engineering courses as I have maintained Dean's List throughout every 
semester so far. I feel taking these engineering classes helped me to have an open mind toward my coding and helped me to tackle my problems in a better and more
efficient manner.
