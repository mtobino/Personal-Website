## About Me
![ProfilePic](img/ProPhoto.jpg){ align=right width="200" }
I am a rising senior at Rowan Unveristy pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I originally started out as a Mechanical Engineering Student, but I found I 
had a greater aptittude for coding than physics. However, that did not stop me from succeeding in the engineering courses as I maintained Dean's List throughout every 
semester so far. I feel taking these engineering classes helped me to have an open mind towards my coding and helps me to tackle my problems in a better and more
efficient manner.
